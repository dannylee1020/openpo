## What is Preference Optimization?

Preference Optimization is a method to improve AI models based on human feedback about which outputs are better. Think of it as having a cooking show where judges taste two dishes and pick the better one - over time, the chef (AI model) learns what people prefer and gets better at cooking. By collecting preference data from humans and fine-tuning the model, models become better at capturing nuanced judgements and better align its output with what humans find desirable.

### How It Works

1. The AI model generates multiple responses
2. Humans compare these responses and pick the better one
3. The model learns from these preferences to generate better responses in the future

### Why It Matters
It helps models:

- Personalize to user's preference
- Be more helpful and relevant
- Follow instructions better
- Generate safer and more appropriate responses


OpenPO makes it easy to collect this valuable preference data - the first step in improving your own AI models.
